# :computer: Push Notifications (app)

This is the frontend web app that will be served to browsers, with UX to send a push notification to the browser, and check permissions.

# :bow: Implementation

This app uses [Material UI](https://mui.com/) for a quick, simple design, on top of [React](https://reactjs.org/).
