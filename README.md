# :bell: Push Notifications (Demo)

This repository exists to serve as a demo for the [Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API), which can be viewed on [demo.push-notifications.app](https://demo.push-notifications.app).

This demo is intended to be deployed via [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/), for convenience. But the applications are written to be compatible outside of this deployment mechanism.

# :nerd_face: Disclaimer

At the time of writing this it does not appear to work on Safari, I'm not sure why.

This project was created by @WebGL3D with the primary purpose of learning how the push API works. It is open source, please feel free to take and learn from this project whatever you want. If it helps even one person understand this complicated setup, the goal of it being open source will be reached.

Assume I may not know what I'm talking about, but I tried my best.
