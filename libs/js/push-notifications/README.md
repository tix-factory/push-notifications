# :books: @tix-factory/push-notifications

This is a module for interacting with the [Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API) with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

This module primarily comes into existence so I can access these React hooks in my other projects.

They are open source, anyone may choose to use, or copy from this module. Enjoy!
